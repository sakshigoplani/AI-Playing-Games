The custom C++ files for the entities are located in
Code/GameSDK/GameDll/MyAI

The scripts folder contains the scripts for all the entities - the counter
terrorist, the medic and the terrorist(human).
The lua scripts are located in
GameSDK/Scripts/Entities/AI/Characters/

The behavior trees for all the entities are located in
Scripts/AI/BehaviorTrees/
The Friend.xml file corresponds to the behavior of the counter terrorist.
The MedicTree.xml file corresponds to the behavior of the medic
For the terrorist, we're using SDKGrunt02.xml because the terrorist is almost at
the top of the food chain and he has to have a simple behavior.
This behavior tree consists of a simple idle state and a combat state.

The level files are located in GameSDK/levels/
